    <string name="field_description">The playing field is a 10Ã—10 square for each player, on which a fleet of ships is placed. The verticals are numbered from top to bottom and the horizontals are marked with letters from left to right.</string>
    <string name="number_and_placement_of_ships">Number and placement of ships</string>
    <string name="number_and_placement_of_ships_description">There is a certain layout of ships on the playing field. The ship consists of several decks or pipes (hence the name, for example, \"two-deck\" or \"two-pipe\"). On the playing field are:\n\t\t\t1 four-deck, ship, battleship, - a row of four cells;\n\t\t\t2 three-deck, cruisers, - rows of 3 cells;\n\t\t\t3 double-deck, destroyers, - rows of 2 cells;\n\t\t\t4 single-deck ships, torpedo boats, - 1 cell.\nWhen placing ships, they cannot touch each other with sides and corners.</string>

    <string name="game_progress_description">The instruction defines the conditions and sequence of moves:\n\t\t\t1. Initially, it is randomly chosen, who goes first.\n\t\t\t2. By taking the \"shot\", the player clicks on an enemy cell of the field.\n\t\t\t3. A cross is then placed in the cell; if hit, the cell is also painted over.\n\t\t\t4. If you miss, the right to move passes to another player; if you hit, the player turns again.\n\t\t\t5. A ship is considered sunk when all its cells are painted over. The winner is the one who first sinks all the ships of his opponent.</string>
